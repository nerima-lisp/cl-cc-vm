;;;; Test entry point: register this checkout with ASDF, inherit the caller's
;;;; configuration for everything else, and run the test system.
;;;;
;;;; cl-weave arrives through CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY, which flake.nix sets for
;;;; `nix flake check`, `nix run .#test` and `nix develop` alike. That is why
;;;; there is no dependency-locating machinery here any more: the old
;;;; scripts/bootstrap.lisp parsed .asd files by hand and loaded cl-weave's
;;;; sources one by one, because cl-weave used to be pulled in as a bare
;;;; source tree under CL_CC_AST_CL_WEAVE_ROOT rather than as a flake input.
;;;;
;;;; An empty suite still fails: cl-cc-vm/test's :perform passes
;;;; :pass-with-no-tests nil to cl-weave, so a run that registers zero tests
;;;; is an error rather than a pass.
